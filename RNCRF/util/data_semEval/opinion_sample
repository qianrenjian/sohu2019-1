Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.##good +1, not any longer -1
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.##rude -1
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.##lousy -1, tiny -1
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
Avoid this place!##Avoid -1
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.##outrageously good +1
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.##best +1
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.##amazing +1, out of this world +1
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.##interesting +1, good values +1
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.##disappointed -1
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
Food was okay, nothing great.##okay +1, nothing great -1
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.##dry -1, greasy -1
I/we will never go back to this place again.##never go back -1
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!##glad +1, great +1
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!##devine +1, sensual +1
You can't go wrong here.
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.##excellent +1, cool +1, understated +1
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.##incredible +1
Can't wait wait for my next visit.
I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.' 
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.##average -1, too sweet +1
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.##enjoyed +1
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).##innovative +1, tasty +1
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.##night -1, un-appetizing -1, sleek +1, modern +1
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
What's the difference between the two?
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!##extensive +1
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!##good +1, awesome +1, great +1
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!##great +1
we love th pink pony.##love +1
THe perfect spot.##perfect +1
Food - awesome.##awesome +1
Service - friendly and attentive.##friendly +1, attentive +1
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish.##relaxed +1, stylish +1
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.
(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..) 
the food is decent.##decent +1
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.##bad taste -1
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.##bad -1
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. 
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.##best +1
I had a great experience.
Food is great.##great +1
Service is top notch.##top notch +1
I have been going back again and again.
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.##heavenly +1
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.##fresh +1, adequately proportioned +1
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they didn't try to overpack the rice.##good +1
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.##worth +1
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.##attracted +1
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.##well prepared +1, impecable +1
I'm going back.
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.##attentive +1, better +1, extensive +1
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).##worth +1
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!##recommend +1
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
It is terrific, as is the value.##terrific +1
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.##tasty +1, fresh +1
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.##great +1
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
Go hungry and enjoy.
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.##good +1
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing.##like +1, disappointing -1
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.##nice +1
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.##slow -1
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.##bland -1
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.##pretty +1, nice +1
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.##great +1, great +1
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.##incredible +1, recommend +1
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.##off-the-beaten +1
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.##cozy +1
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.##average to above-average +1, impressive +1, brilliant +1
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!##cold -1, melted +1
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.##overpriced -1, soggy -1
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.##fancy +1, good +1
A big disappointment, all around.
